We have been going to them for about 5 years now and they have never let us down. They are like family. We have unfortunately had to put several of our beloved pets down and they cried right along with us. They always check up on our pets and I highly recommend them. We just can't say enough good things about them and their staff. Love to all of them.\"</span></span></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>"

The office and staff are very professional and nice. I went there for a second opinion regarding my 14 yr old Maltese. He suffers from heart and kidneys and had a persistent cough for many months. Dr. Sam treated him with additional medicine and his coughing has stopped. My second opinion appointment resulted in trusting Cornerstone doctors to take care of my four dogs permanently. I am also pleased that they are available after hours, on weekends and on holidays too.\"</span></span></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>"
