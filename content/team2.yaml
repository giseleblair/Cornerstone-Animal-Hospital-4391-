After she met her husband, Cole, they spent a few years in southwest Missouri where she worked for another mixed animal veterinary practice. They moved back to Georgia in the summer of 2021 and she started a new job at Cornerstone Animal Hospital. She is currently enrolled in an online Registered Veterinary Technician program with hopes of gaining all of the knowledge she can to continue to advocate and care for her patients. She has devoted all of her life to helping and caring for animals of all kinds. In addition to helping all of the many patients that Megan has cared for, she also enjoys opening her home to any pet in need. Megan and her husband enjoy spending time with their many fur kids, riding around in the great outdoors, or even cuddling up on the couch on a rainy day.</p>"

She studied veterinary technology assistance and fear-free practice at Ashworth College. Although her passion is for all furry friends, our feline friends tend to put an extra sparkle in her eyes. She enjoys spending time with her husband, kids, and many furbabies at home. She looks forward to the future and the adventures ahead.</p>"
